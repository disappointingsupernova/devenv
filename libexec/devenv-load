# Usage: devenv load <name>
# Summary: Load a profile by name
# Help: This command can load specific files/env specified inside a profile.
# This command will output the required export to setup the current shell, will
# not perform any action. To make it effective, use $(devenv load profile).
# This is a safety mechanism, plus help with debugging. Always run it easy 
# first :)
#
# The profile is a folder which can contain:
# - 'envs' file, which should be composed of environment variable and values 
#   separated by =.
#   Empty lines or line starting with # are ignored.
#   An empty line and the end of the file is MANDATORY.
# - 'ssh' folder, which should contain all files normally inside $HOME/.ssh
#   Please note that $HOME/.ssh will be DESTROYED.
